1. Everywhere their is something written in a () i.e. bracket replace it with the actual value.
For example
aireplay-ng -0 (channel no.) -a (mac address of the router) -c (mac address of the client 1)  (interface name)
replace this with
aireplay-ng -0 7 -a 80:58:F8:D8:7C:BE -c BC:D1:1F:CC:60:B4  wlo1
2. if the no. of users are more than 3 then just add some more else if statements
3. This code will disconnect 1 user every second and will reconnect them after that causing a great nuisance.
4. some prerequisite are there in prerequisite file
